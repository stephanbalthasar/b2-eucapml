# B's Bot. Your AI  Mentor for EU  Capital Markets Law.
An app for students in the Bayreuth University EU Capital Markets Law course
B's Bot (the App) is a modular, privacy‑respecting AI tutor for European and German capital markets law.  
It provides two distinct learning modes:

1. **Exam‑style self‑testing** using sample cases and AI‑generated feedback  
2. **RAG‑augmented legal tutoring** using the course booklet + selected EU/DE sources

The system is designed to be lightweight, explainable, and easily maintainable.  
This repository contains a complete redesign of a previous version, based on modular, testable components.

## 🧭 Architecture Overview

The App is built from three conceptual layers:

### **1. Engines (top‑level orchestration)**
These implement the high‑level behaviours:
- **`FeedbackEngine`** → evaluates student answers against model solutions **and** provides:
  - **Plan**: help students plan an answer before writing (outline, topics, anchors)
  - **Evaluate**: assess a finished answer (similarity, coverage, structured feedback)
  - **Explain**: answer follow‑up “why” questions about the feedback
- **`ChatEngine`** → RAG‑augmented legal tutor (booklet + optional web), independent of model answers

Each engine has its own prompts, retrieval strategy, and post‑processing.

### **2. Shared subsystems**
Reusable modules used by both engines:

- **RAG subsystem** (booklet index, retrieval, filtering)
- **LLM subsystem** (model‑agnostic interface)
- **Booklet parsing** (DOCX → semantic chunks)
- **Core utilities** (keyword extraction, similarity, citation helpers)
- **Prompts** (separate prompt logic for both engines)

### **3. UI layer**
A thin Streamlit UI (`streamlit_app.py`) calling into the engines.

### **4. Assets**
Assets (e.g., course booklet, sample cases, model answers) will be sitting in a private repo.

## ⚙️ Module Responsibilities
### **Modules at a glance**
- `app/bootstrap_booklet.py` — Pulls booklet json from private repo.
- `app/bootstrap_cases.py` — Pulls cases with model answers (json) from private repo.

- `mentor/engines/feedback_engine.py` — Plan / Evaluate / Explain a case.
- `mentor/engines/chat_engine.py` — RAG‑augmented tutor (booklet + optional web).
- `mentor/rag/` — booklet index + filters + snippet retrieval.
- `mentor/llm/` — model‑agnostic client (e.g., Groq).
- `mentor/booklet/` — parse DOCX booklet, extract anchors.
- `mentor/core.py` — shared helpers (keywords, similarity, citations).
- `mentor/prompts.py` — prompts (evaluator, planner, explainer, chat).

### **engines/**
#### `feedback_engine.py`
Implements the exam-style evaluation workflow:
- slice correct model answer  
- extract issues  
- compute similarity & coverage  
- retrieve relevant booklet/web snippets  
- generate structured feedback  
- enforce consistency with model answer  

#### `chat_engine.py`
Implements the RAG‑augmented legal tutor:
- extract legal keywords  
- retrieve relevant booklet snippets  
- (optionally) retrieve selected EU/DE web sources  
- assemble a grounded LLM answer  
- no model‑answer logic, no exam structure  

---

### **llm/**
#### `client.py`
Defines an abstract interface:

python
class LLMClient:
    def chat(self, messages: list[dict], **kwargs) -> str:
        ...

This allows swapping Groq, OpenRouter, or local models without changing engines.
groq.py
Concrete implementation for Groq’s Llama models.

---

### **rag/**
#### `booklet_retriever.py`
Builds and stores the semantic index of booklet chunks:

chunking
embeddings
metadata
caching

Used by both engines with different settings.
---

#### `prompts.py`
Contains two distinct prompt sets:


Feedback Evaluator prompts
Strict, rule-based, structured (five sections, citations, model alignment)


Tutor Chat prompts
Conversational, explanatory, RAG‑grounded, no exam structure


Optionally includes shared guardrails.

---

### **🧪 Testing Strategy (recommended)**
Add tests under tests/:

booklet parsing
RAG retrieval
similarity/coverage metrics
LLM client mock responses
